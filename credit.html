      <p class=header_1>Credit Program for High School</p>
      <p>Aarthi Krishnamoorthy</p>
      <p class=header_2>What triggered CTA into action ?</p>
      <p>High school curriculum in this country involves a second language, which 
        in California, may be Spanish, French or Chinese (offered in a limited 
        number of schools).</p>
      <p>Tamil is not one of the accredited languages. There is a large Tamil 
        speaking community in California whose children did not have the opportunity 
        to learn the language that their parents and family spoke at home.</p>
      <p>When Mrs. Vetriselvi Rajamanickam was faced with a similar situation 
        with her children she decided to explore the option of getting the appropriate 
        accreditation to teach Tamil as a second language at high school. She 
        also realized that teaching young children to learn their Mother Tongue 
        would help them to develop confidence, self-esteem.</p>
      <p class=header_2>CTA Initiatives to accreditation for Tamil</p>
      <p>CTA, with Mrs. Vetriselvi in the lead set to work immediately.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>CTA contacted the Spanish and French teachers at Saratoga High School 
          and also the parents in the Chinese Community in Saratoga to get all 
          the necessary information which would help her in the quest to make 
          Tamil as a credited second language at high school.</p>
        <p>CTA had also contacted several important officials in the District 
          Board of education and came in touch with Dr. Mary Stone, who is the 
          Associate superintendent, Education Planning / Development. With Dr. 
          Stone's guidance the basic qualifying conditions given below were clearly 
          laid out and all the necessary papers submitted with the Board of education:</p>
		  <blockquote>
		  <p> Syllabus / Curriculum for the credit program<br>
		  Structure of the class<br>
		  Books and other study materials</p>
		  </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
	  <p class=header_2>Approval</p>
	  <p>The approval was received in October 2003 from he Fremont Union School District to allow CTA to teach Tamil in public high schools at Cupertino and Sunnyvale. </p>
	  <p class=header_1>CTA Approach</p>
	  <p class=header_2>Curriculum</p>
	  <p>The focus of he entire curriculum includes the simultaneous development 
        of basic vocabulary (noun, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.,) and he construction 
        of sentences of varying degrees of complexity (form simple to more complex) 
        and the ability to construct and write sentences in Tamil . This includes 
        using the correct tense, count, gender or otherwise precise forms of various 
        words.</p>
	  <p class=header_2>Teachers</p>
	  <p>Dr. Sivakumar, who has extensive teaching experience (though not in Tamil) 
        in several universities in the United States like Stanford, University 
        of Houston, State University of NewYork, Buffalo for over 10 years was 
        chosen as the leader of a team of teachers for the credit program.</p>
	  <p class=header_2>The team included</p>
	  <p>Mrs. Nalayini Gunanayakam who has been actively involved in teaching Tamil for several years in the bay area Tamil community and who was involved with the CTA for teaching Tamil to Adults Mrs. Kavitha Senthilkumar who has been teaching Tamil at CTA for the level high school grade II Mrs. Aarthi Krishnamoorthy who has been teaching Tamil in CTA for the Pre-school level and elementary level.</p>
	  <p class=header_2>Student Performance</p>
	  <p>The students have shown great enthusiasm and thirst for learning the language. Attending such a program helps them relate well with their families and increases the family bonding as mentioned by several parents.</p>
	  <p>They have consistently and categorically demonstrated the knowledge they have acquired in evaluation components. They have shown tremendous progress in terms of grasping the nuances of the language. </p>
	  <p class=header_2>Graduation List</p>
	  <p>CTA would send the list of students who graduate from the credit program course, at the end of the school year, to he District Officer who will make the necessary arrangement to have the course credit posted to the student's transcript.</p>
	  <p class=header_2>Summary</p>
	  <p>CTA, with the continued support from the school district, Dr. Mary Stone, the community, the teachers and the students, would be unrelenting in its strive to improve the quality of education it imparts to very high levels.</p>
