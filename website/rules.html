      <p class=header_1>School Rules and Regulations</p>
	 
      <p>The primary objective of Tamil Heritage (THA) Academy is to provide the best Tamil educational program and learning environment possible to every student. Excellent behavior is expected of all THA students. All THA teachers and officers are provided with the Manual which discusses THA policy, rules and regulations, responsibilities and expectations.</p>
      <p class="header_2">  Student Attendance Policy:</p>
      <p><b>Perfect Attendance:</b>All students with 100% perfect attendance, attending all the classes at THA  are honored with a perfect attendance  trophy  on the graduation day. 100% attendance is required to qualify for perfect attendance award. The students must be present in the class when the school starts which is usually 10:00am to qualify for perfect attendance.</p>
      <p><b>Absence Policy:</b> An absence will be marked as absent in the attendance record irrespective of the reason.  Since attendance carries 10% of final score, it is important that the student attends all the classes.</p>
      <p class="header_2"> Student Evaluation Tests </p>
      <p>
      All the new students above 6 years of age are evaluated for their Tamil skill. Depending on the evaluation test score, the students are assigned to the right grade. 
The returning student may also be evaluated for promotion to next grade. The evaluation procedure (http://www.catamilacademy.org/evaluation.html)  discusses the criteria, evaluation procedure etc.
      </p>
            
     <p class="header_2"> Student Progress Report Policy: </p>
      <p><strong> Term Progress Report: </strong></p>
      <p> At the end of each term, teachers issue a progress report to the students. Parents are encouraged to contact the child's teacher or the school Principal to discuss students' progress. If necessary, a parent teacher meeting can be scheduled to review the student's progress  and set goals to promote achievement.</p>
      <p><strong> Annual Student&rsquo;s Rank Report: </strong></p>
      <p><strong> (Year-round Evaluation of student&rsquo;s skills and knowledge)</strong></p>
      <p> Each student will be observed in the class by his/her teacher on every school day for his/her attendance, class participation and homework skills. Additionally students in the higher grade levels will  be observed for reading, recital, writing projects and book reports etc. All these observations are entered into the student's  log book every week. 
 </p>
      <p> This information will be used at the end of the year, along with the student's Term Test scores and Final exam score, to calculate the year-round performance of the student and to promote the students to the next grade. </p>
      <p> <span class="header_2"> Disciplinary Action:</span></p><p>
  THA believes in disciplining the students in a positive way. THA reserves the right to take any appropriate disciplinary action to preserve the orderliness of the class. The student will be given 2 verbal warnings for any misconduct in the class. After that, the teacher will notify the parent. If needed, the parent will sit in the class to observe their child's conduct and work with the teacher to discipline the student. It is the parent's responsibility to make sure that the student does not disturb the class by bringing toys, comic books, video games, walkman etc to school. Tobacco, alcohol, weapons and illegal drugs are prohibited in the school premises. These items are not allowed in the classroom. Bringing pets is not allowed in the class or school premises. </p>
      <p><span class="header_2"> Student Drop and Pickup policy:</span></p>
      <p>Parents are responsible for dropping the kids in the appropriate class room and picking up kids from class on time. THA is not responsible for any untoward behavior/activities from both kids and parents that affect the general atmosphere of the premises where the classes are held. THA is not responsible for the kids and their whereabouts beyond the duration of the published class timings. Each parent is responsible to follow the parking rules of the premises where the classes are held (e.g. obtain required parking permits where necessary). THA is not responsible for any parking violations by the student, parents, or the volunteers.</p>
        <p class="header_2"> Emergency Evacuation Procedure: </p>
      <p> Every year THA conducts emergency drill in all the branches and we give emergency handbook to all our teachers and officers. Copies of the Emergency Evacuation procedure will be posted in the school premises.</p>


      <p class="header_2"> Emergency Medical care for students: </p>
      <p> In case of any medical emergency, the student will be taken to the nearest hospital or will be cared by the emergency medical team. We will call 911 in case of emergency and will notify the parents. In case of  non-life threatening injuries, we will notify the parents only. The student will be cared for and kept comfortable. It is the parent's responsibility to transport the student to the doctor. <strong>THA is not financially responsible for any medical procedures rendered.  </strong></p>
      <p class="header_2"> Soliciting in the premises of THA: </p>
      <p> The THA Board does not allow anyone to solicit, advertise, use the THA notice board for non-THA flyers, or sell tickets for any non-THA related events within the premises of THA.  Any flyers must be approved in writing by the school Principals or the board before they are posted in the school premises.</p>
      <p><span class="header_2">Announcing Non-public information about THA and Students:</span></p>
      <p>
      The THA Board strictly prohibits any announcement, advertisement or speech about any non-public information about THA, the Board or the students without the permission of the Board. If a parent or a teacher or any individual would like to give such public announcements, he or she should get prior approval of the THA Board (www.catamilacademy.org). If an individual fails to follow this rule, he or she will be issued a verbal warning at the first incident. Subsequent similar actions will result in the removal of his/her child/children from the school and the individual will also be asked to step down from any staff position at THA.    </p>
