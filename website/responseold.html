      <p class=header_1>CTA-Teacher's Responsibilities</p>
      <p class=header_2> Commitment:</p>
      <p><br>
        Teachers should commit to teaching till the end of the school year (Sep 
        to May). For some unforeseen reasons, if a teacher has to quit, he or 
        she will notify the Selvi Rajamanickam at least 2 weeks ahead of the time 
        of quitting.</p>
      <p class=header_2>Vacation / Unable to attend:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><img src="images/bullet.gif" width="12" height="12">Teachers will come 
          to school on every working day of the school. <br>
          <img src="images/bullet.gif" width="12" height="12">If there is a planned vacation, Selvi Rajamanickam has to be notified 
          ahead of time (as soon as the vacation plans are finalized). <br>
          <img src="images/bullet.gif" width="12" height="12">If the teacher cannot come to school on a certain Sunday due to unexpected 
          reasons or sickness, the Administrative Office has to be notified (408-741-0612) 
          before 9:00 AM on that Sunday. <br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=header_2> Punctuality:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><img src="images/bullet.gif" width="12" height="12">Teachers will come to school on time and be a positive roll model for 
          the students in observing punctuality. <br>
          <img src="images/bullet.gif" width="12" height="12">Teachers will teach the students until the class ends at 11:15 AM. If 
          the teacher has to leave early due to some unavoidable reasons, he or 
          she will contact the Selvi Rajamanickam, so a substitute teacher can 
          be arranged for the remaining time. <br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=header_2> Teacher's Log:</p>
      <p><br>
        On every working day, the teachers will go to the Administrative Office 
        to sign-up to receive the Teacher's Log before going to the classroom. 
        The teacher will record the specifics in the log on each working day. 
        At the end of the class, the teachers will return the Log to the Administrative 
        Office. </p>
      <p class=header_2>School Rules:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><img src="images/bullet.gif" width="12" height="12">Teachers will be aware of the School Rules and Regulations and will 
          abide by them explicitly. Teachers will also be aware of the duties 
          of other Officers and other Contact Persons and will follow them accordingly. 
          </p>
		  <p>
          <img src="images/bullet.gif" width="12" height="12">If there are questions from the parents or students about the school, 
          the teacher will receive the questions in a polite manner and direct 
          them to the appropriate Contact Person. If the teacher does not know 
          whom to contact, he or she will notify the Selvi Rajamanickam about 
          the inquiry. <p></P>
          <img src="images/bullet.gif" width="12" height="12">The teacher will NOT talk about or give out any non-public information 
          about the school, administration or any personal information about other 
          students to any parents. The teacher will refer the parent to the Administrative 
          Office. <br>
        
      </blockquote>
      <p class=header_2>Staff-Meeting:</p>
      <p> Teachers will attend all 3 staff meetings to express their issues and 
        concerns and listen to the suggestions of other teachers and the Board. 
        Teachers will notify the issues ahead of the meeting.</p>
      <p class=header_2>Syllabus:</p>
      <p><br>
        The teacher will follow the planned syllabus and will teach the appropriate 
        skills proposed by the syllabus committee for that grade level. Teachers 
        are welcome to teach outside the syllabus, appropriately, after they complete 
        the planned syllabus and the skills at the given time.</p>
      <p class=header_2>Test Question Papers:</p>
      <p><br>
        It is the teacher's responsibility to make the Quiz/Test Question papers 
        and Final Exam model and final exam question papers for his/her class 
        on time and to give it to the Officer that collects the Question papers.</p>
      <p class=header_2>Student Discipline:</p>
      <p><br>
