<h4>CTA teaches Tamil in public schools in California</h4>
<p> We would like to share good news with you. Our school, California Tamil Academy received approval from Fremont Union School District to teach Tamil in the public high school. This covers two areas, Cupertino and Sunnyvale. This is our first step. Soon, we will try to get approval in other school districts.</p>
<h4>Below are what and how our students can get the credit from the public school</h4>
<p>Fremont union high school district has agreed to give credit for courses taught by CTA for two years. High school students, grades 9-12, who successfully complete a two year-long course at the CTA School, and who achieve a passing score on the competency exam, will be able to receive 5 units for one semester in the elective area to apply towards meeting the overall number of units needed for high school graduation. These units may not be used to meet the ten unit graduation requirement in the "modern Language, Applied Arts, or Fine Arts" area.</p>
<p>At the end of the school year, we would send the list of students who passed our credit program course that includes the detail information about each student (Name of the student, Grade Level, Home high school, Date of birth and Final letter grade received for the course) and the Fremont Union School District officer will make necessary arrangement to have the course credit posted to the student's transcript.</p>
