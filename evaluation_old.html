      <p class=header_1>Rules and regulations for evaluation:</p>
	 
      <p><b>1. </b>Two times in a year students are allowed to take the evaluation test</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>&nbsp;All new students should take the evaluation test if they want 
            to register there kids from Basic 2 by November second week.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>&nbsp;Old students who want to move from their assigned class to 
            next level can take the test before last working date of September.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>&nbsp;After school starts, the student class teacher or parent feels 
            that the student is eligible to move to the next level, teacher should 
            give a recommendation letter for their student to take the test before 
            the first term quiz.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>2. </b> We also have to check the age limit which we have given in our 
        skill set for each level. There are some old students who are exempted 
        from the age limit we have set for each grade. But we are strictly enforcing 
        the age restrictions for all the new students. Parents are not given the 
        option to move their children to higher grades if they do not meet the 
        age limit. This should at the sole discretion of the teacher who is teaching 
        the child. So in this case any new/old student, who wants to move and 
        want to be evaluated for a grade higher than what he/she is studying in, 
        will be evaluated in November (by November second week). If a teacher 
        feels that at the end of the year, the student can move two levels up 
        then we recommend the student to take an evaluation immediately. </p>
      
	  <p class=header_1>Basic 1 Advance Level:</p>
	  <p>The school will automatically place the students who are the age of 10 and above in Basic 1 advance class. They will be doing Basic 1 and 2 for a year and if they passed the test they will be placed in Basic 3. Every branch will follow the syllabus and question paper for the advance level which is provided by CTA. </p>
      <p>If the advance level students would like to move to grade 1 they must take a evaluation test before the school closes or before September second week.</p>
