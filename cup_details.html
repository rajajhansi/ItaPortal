Dear CTA Cupertino Parents,<br /><br />

Vanakkam.

<p>

We are extremely sorry to give a late notice that the deanza facility is not available for our use due to construction project at DeAnza so we are unable to start the school at DeAnza on Aug 28 as per schedule. DeAnza will be available to us from first week of October.

We are happy to inform you that we signed an agreement with west valley college, saratoga to start the classes from  Sep 11  2011 to Oct 2 2011. This is a temporary arrangement and we will back to deanza from Oct 9 2011.
